# Plas-tech: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Plastic Waste Management

This repository contains a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) project aimed at optimizing the collection and conversion of plastic waste into cooking gas. Utilizing a customized environment and a model based on Deep Q-Networks (DQN), this project simulates the efficient management and processing of plastic waste within a defined grid-like environment.

## Features

- **Custom Environment**: Uses a gym-like environment designed specifically for simulating the collection and processing of plastic waste.
- **DQN Implementation**: Employs a neural network to approximate Q-values, with the state input being the agentâ€™s position and status on the grid.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Includes scripts for training the DRL agent and evaluating its performance in optimizing waste processing.

## Project Structure

- `plastech_env.py`: Defines the custom environment for plastic waste management.
- `train.py`: Contains the script to train the DQN agent.
- `play.py`: Demonstrates the trained agent in action within the simulation.
- `test_env.py`: Provides a script for testing the environment setup.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all necessary Python packages for the project.
- `models/`: Directory to store trained models.

## Environment Setup

The custom environment, `plastech_env.py`, simulates a grid where an agent navigates to collect and process plastic waste efficiently. The agent receives positive rewards for successful collection and processing, and negative rewards for inefficient actions.

## Installation

To set up and run the DQN model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Plas-tech.git
   cd Plas-tech
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Unix or MacOS
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Training Script**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Training the Agent**:
  Use the `train.py` script to train the agent with adjustable hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of episodes, etc.

- **Evaluating the Agent**:
  Post training, evaluate the agent's performance using the `play.py` script to see how well it navigates through the environment to manage waste.
